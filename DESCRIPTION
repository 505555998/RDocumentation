Description: The RDocumentation package wraps around the default help functionality in R. Instead of plain documentation files, documentation will now show up as it does on RDocumentation.org, a platform that shows R documentation from CRAN, GitHub and BioConductor, together with informative stats to assess the package quality and possibilities to discuss packages.
